Word Castle is a brain teasing word game developed in .NET Framework 2.0 when I was pursuing my undergraduate studies.

Setup Instructions:

1. Download the setup file in WordCastle Installer

3. You need to download the Visual J# 2.0 Redistributable Package-Second Edition with respect your Windows OS version.

Use the below link to download the respective Redistributable package.

Once the application is installed you can find the desktop Icon. You   	can now run the application.

A short video will be played while starting the application. If the video is not being played or if you get only a black screen displayed, right click to play/pause/exit the video.

Thanks for downloading...

Have a great day!!!!!
